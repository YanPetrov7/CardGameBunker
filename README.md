# Card Game Bunker

Bunker is an incredibly atmospheric game with a great narrative part. This is a unique opportunity to experience the coming of the apocalypse and test your negotiation and deductive skills in order to survive! The game immediately immerses you and your company in the game "with your head." Interesting cataclysms and character characteristics make the gameplay even more intense. The game also produces a certain therapeutic effect, because discussing how to survive a disaster, the world outside the window will seem relatively beautiful. The game is able to disturb the soul, forcing you to experience and sympathize.
